<h1>Getting start with SynSin</h1>

To quickly start using the code, first download the pretrained models. Then use the demo code in order to visualise the models in action.


<h2> Download pretrained models </h2>

* Download the models using `bash ./download_models.sh`. This should create a `./modelcheckpoints` directory with a readme.txt explaining the pretrained models. 

<h2> Running demo code </h2>

To just run a model on a given image and set the view transform, we have included a simple demo notebook `./demos/Simple Demo.ipynb`.

We have also included an interactive demo notebook in `./demos/Interactive Demo.ipynb`. This shows how to load a model, and update camera/view parameters interactively.

To use our models on unseen images, we recommend looking at these notebooks.
